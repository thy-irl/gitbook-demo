### Enhance testing efficiency[​](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/about-katalon-studio#enhance-testing-efficiency) <a href="#enhance-testing-efficiency" id="enhance-testing-efficiency"></a>

Katalon Studio offers unique testing capabilities to help you optimize your testing process:

* Combine multiple application types (Web UI, API, Mobile & Desktop) in one project and execution flow. You can test this capability using our [GitHub sample projects](https://github.com/katalon-studio-samples).
* You can create tests by simply interacting with your application using Recorder and Spy. Then, edit your test case using interchangeable interfaces between manual and script editors.
* Reduce your test maintenance efforts with [self-healing](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/maintain-tests/self-healing-tests-in-katalon-studio), [Smart Wait function](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/record-and-spy/webui-record-and-spy-utilities/smart-wait-function), and [Time Capsule](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/maintain-tests/fix-broken-web-test-objects-with-time-capsule-in-katalon-studio).
* Utilize the built-in keywords and reusable custom keywords in test creating.
* Leverage a built-in AI-powered assistant that explains code snippet and generates code from natural language prompts. Learn more at [StudioAssist in Katalon Studio](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/create-test-cases/studioassist-in-katalon-studio).
